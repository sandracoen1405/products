## Updating Changelog

If you open a GitHub pull request on this repo, please update `CHANGELOG` to reflect your contribution.

Add your entry under `Unreleased` as `Breaking changes`, `New features`, `Fixes` or `Internal`.

These sections follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), where:

- `Breaking changes` corresponds to a `major` (1.X.X) change.
- `New features` corresponds to a `minor` (X.1.X) change.
- `Fixes` corresponds to a `patch` (X.X.1) change.
- `Internal` corresponds to changes to the project that are not part of the public API, for example fixing the CI build server.

See the [`CHANGELOG_TEMPLATE.md`](/docs/contribution/CHANGELOG_TEMPLATE.md) for an example for how this looks.

Include the modified `CHANGELOG` in the PR.

## Application tasks

See [tasks](/docs/contributing/tasks.md).

## Deploying

## Versioning

We are not using semantic versioning yet, we are going to talk about this soon.

See `CHANGELOG` for more information.

## Releasing a new version
