## DevOps

[DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) is a set of practices, a mindset, a culture. Not a set of tools or a distinct team. Modern cross-functional teams have engineers that are DevOps capable allowing the team to be fully responsible for deploying and running their products all the way to production.
