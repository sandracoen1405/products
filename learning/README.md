# Continuous Professional Development

This project contains the source code for the Continuous Professional Development portal, which can be found at: https://cpd.mhra.gov.uk/

This site is for healthcare professionals responsible for prescribing, supplying or administering medicines. It can be used by trainees, those looking to update or refresh their knowledge or clinicians moving into a new area. The modules cover aspects of medicines regulation as well as the risks of commonly-prescribed specific classes of medicines.
